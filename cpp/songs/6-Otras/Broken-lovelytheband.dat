<strong>
  Am             
I like that you're broken
Fa
Broken like me
C                      G
Maybe that makes me a fool
  Am 
I like that you're lonely
F
Lonely like me
C                      G
I could be lonely with you

          Dm                Am
I met you late night, at a party
                C                 G
Some trust fund baby's Brooklyn loft
        Dm                        Am
By the bathroom, you said: Let's talk
         C                   G
But my confidence is wearing off

                Dm
These aren't my people
                Am
These aren't my friends
               C
She grabbed my face 
                    G
and that's when she said
<strong>
  Am             
I like that you're broken
F
Broken like me
C                      G
Maybe that makes me a fool
  Am 
I like that you're lonely
F
Lonely like me
C                       G
I could be lonely with you

                   Dm
There’s something tragic, 
            Am
but almost pure
               C         
Think I could love you, 
           G
but I’m not sure
                   Dm
There’s something wholesome, 
                 Am
there’s something sweet
                C    
Tucked in your eyes 
                 G
that I’d love to meet

                Dm
These aren’t my people
                Am
These aren’t my friends
               C
She grabbed my face

              Em       Am
Life is not a love song that we like
                 Dm      G
We’re all broken pieces floating by
              Em       Am
Life is not a love song we can try
                  Dm         G
To fix our broken pieces one at a time
<strong>
   Am
I like that you’re broken

Broken like me
C                        G
Maybe that makes me a fool

I like that you’re lonely

Lonely like me
C                        G
I could be lonely with you (**)
