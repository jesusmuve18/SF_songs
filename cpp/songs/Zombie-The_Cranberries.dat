Another head hangs lowly
Mi6             Si9(11)/Re#  do#m
Child is slowly taken
                La7
And the violence caused such silence
Mi6           Si9(11)/Re#
Who are we mistaken?

But you see,    it's not me
            La7
It's not my     family
            Mi6    
In your head,    in your head
            Si9(11)/Re#
They are fighting
                do#m
With their tanks    and their bombs
                La7
And their bombs,     and their guns
            Mi6
In your head,     in your head 
            Si9(11)/Re#
They are crying
