I like that you're broken

Broken like me
<b>C</b>                      <b>G</b>
Maybe that makes me a fool
  <b>A m</b>
I like that you're lonely

Lonely like me

I could be lonely with you

I met you late night, at a party
                <b>C</b>                 <b>G</b>
Some trust fund baby's Brooklyn loft
        <b>D m</b>                        <b>A m</b>
By the bathroom, you said: Let's talk
         <b>C</b>                   <b>G</b>
But my confidence is wearing off

                <b>D m</b>
These aren't my people
                <b>A m</b>
These aren't my friends
               <b>C</b>
She grabbed my face 
                    <b>G</b>
and that's when she said
<strong>
  <b>A m</b>
I like that you're broken

Broken like me
<b>C</b>                      <b>G</b>
Maybe that makes me a fool

Lonely like me

There’s something tragic, 
            <b>A m</b>
but almost pure
               <b>C</b>
Think I could love you, 
           <b>G</b>
but I’m not sure
                   <b>D m</b>
There’s something wholesome, 
                 <b>A m</b>
there’s something sweet
                <b>C</b>
Tucked in your eyes 
                 <b>G</b>
that I’d love to meet

                <b>D m</b>
These aren’t my people

These aren’t my friends

Life is not a love song that we like
                 <b>D m</b>      <b>G</b>
We’re all broken pieces floating by
              <b>E m</b>       <b>A m</b>
Life is not a love song we can try
                  <b>D m</b>         <b>G</b>
To fix our broken pieces one at a time
