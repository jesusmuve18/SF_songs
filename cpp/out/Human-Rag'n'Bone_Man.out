<b>Bb m</b>                 <b>G#</b>         <b>Bb m</b>
Maybe I'm foolish, maybe I'm blind

Thinking I can see through this 
    <b>G#</b>            <b>Bb m</b>
and see what's behind

Got no way to prove it 
   <b>G#</b>          <b>Bb m</b>  <b>G#</b>
so maybe I'm blind

             <b>F#</b>
But I'm only human after all, 
         <b>Eb m</b>
I'm only human after all
                        <b>Bb m</b>
Don't put your blame on me, 
               <b>G#</b>       <b>Bb m</b>  <b>G#</b>
don't put your blame on me.

<b>Bb m</b>
Take a look in the mirror 
    <b>G#</b>          <b>Bb m</b>
and what do you see

Do you see it clearer 
    <b>G#</b>       <b>Bb m</b>
or are you deceived
    <b>G#</b>        <b>Bb m</b>     <b>G#</b>
In what you believe.

             <b>F#</b>
Cause I'm only human after all, 
         <b>Eb m</b>
you're only human after all
                        <b>Bb m</b>
Don't put your blame on me, 
               <b>G#</b>       <b>Bb m</b>
don't put your blame on me.

<b>Bb m</b>
Don't ask my opinion, 
      <b>G#</b>        <b>Bb m</b>
don't ask me to lie

Then beg for forgiveness 
    <b>G#</b>         <b>Bb m</b>
for making you cry
<b>G#</b>          <b>Bb m</b>
Making you  cry

                <b>F#</b>
Cause I'm only human after all, 
         <b>Eb m</b>
I'm only human after all
                        <b>Bb m</b>
Don't put your blame on me, 
               <b>G#</b>       <b>Bb m</b>  <b>G#</b>
don't put the blame on me.
