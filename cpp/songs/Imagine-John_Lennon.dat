Do                  Fa
Imagine there's no heaven
Do               Fa
It's easy if you try
Do            Fa
No hell below us
Do              Fa
Above us, only sky

Do                    Fa
Imagine there's no countries
Do               Fa
It isn't hard to do
Do            Fa
Nothing to kill or die for
Do              Fa
And no religion, too

And the world will be as one

Do                    Fa
Imagine no possessions
Do              Fa
I wonder if you can
Do                      Fa
No need for greed or hunger
Do              Fa
A brotherhood of man
