<b>F</b>                <b>C</b>
You promised a lifetime, 
              <b>A m</b>
but left in a moment
             <b>E m</b>                  <b>F</b>
I wonder if you even think about me
           <b>C</b>
Throw me a lifeline cause 
              <b>A m</b>
I'm barely floating
              <b>E m</b>
Stranded and broken

                     <b>F</b>
You know you got me lost in the dark
       <b>C</b>              <b>A m</b>           <b>E m</b>
Is it too late? Is it too late for us?
                     <b>F</b>
You know you got me lost in my heart
       <b>C</b>              <b>A m</b>           <b>E m</b>
Is it too late? Is it too late for us?
<strong>
    <b>F</b>                    <b>C</b>
Oh, why'd you get me so high
                <b>A m</b>
To leave me so low
             <b>E m</b>
To leave me solo
    <b>F</b>                 <b>C</b>
Oh, I was wasting my time 
             <b>A m</b>
hoping you'd call
                    <b>E m</b>
But damn you're so cold
    <b>F</b>                       <b>C</b>
Oh, why'd you make me feel safe
              <b>A m</b>
Just to walk away
               <b>E m</b>
Just to let me go
     <b>F</b>                   <b>C</b>
Oh, why'd you get me so high
               <b>A m</b>
To leave me so low
             <b>E m</b>
To leave me solo

<b>F</b>                <b>C</b>
You look like an angel
                  <b>A m</b>
Thought I was in heaven
                  <b>E m</b>
But now I'm just falling 
                 <b>F</b>
without you with me
                <b>C</b>
I thought I was able 
                 <b>A m</b>
to learn from my lessons
               <b>E m</b>
Was trying my best but

                     <b>F</b>
You know you got me lost in the dark
       <b>C</b>              <b>A m</b>           <b>E m</b>
Is it too late? Is it too late for us?
                     <b>F</b>
You know you got me lost in my heart
       <b>C</b>              <b>A m</b>           <b>E m</b>
Is it too late? Is it too late for us?
