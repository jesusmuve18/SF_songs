Intro: F  C  Am  Em

F                C
You promised a lifetime, 
              Am
but left in a moment
             Em                  F
I wonder if you even think about me
           C
Throw me a lifeline cause 
              Am
I'm barely floating
              Em
Stranded and broken

                     F
You know you got me lost in the dark
       C              Am           Em
Is it too late? Is it too late for us?
                     F
You know you got me lost in my heart
       C              Am           Em
Is it too late? Is it too late for us?
<strong>
    F                    C
Oh, why'd you get me so high
                Am
To leave me so low
             Em
To leave me solo
    F                 C
Oh, I was wasting my time 
             Am
hoping you'd call
                    Em
But damn you're so cold
    F                       C
Oh, why'd you make me feel safe
              Am
Just to walk away
               Em
Just to let me go
     F                   C
Oh, why'd you get me so high
               Am
To leave me so low
             Em
To leave me solo

F                C
You look like an angel
                  Am
Thought I was in heaven
                  Em                   
But now I'm just falling 
                 F
without you with me
                C
I thought I was able 
                 Am
to learn from my lessons
               Em
Was trying my best but

                     F
You know you got me lost in the dark
       C              Am           Em
Is it too late? Is it too late for us?
                     F
You know you got me lost in my heart
       C              Am           Em
Is it too late? Is it too late for us?
