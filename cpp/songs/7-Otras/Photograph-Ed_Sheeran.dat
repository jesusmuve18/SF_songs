We keep this love in a photograph

Where our eyes are never closing

And time's forever frozen still

So you can keep me

Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
                           sim
Holding me closer 'til our eyes meet

And if you hurt me

That's okay, baby, only words bleed

Oh, you can fit me

Inside the necklace you got 
              La
when you were sixteen
 
Next to your heartbeat 
        sim
where I should be

Keep it deep within your soul

When I'm away, I will remember

how you kissed me

Under the lamppost 
        sim
back on Sixth street
                                Sol
Hearing you whisper through the phone

Wait for me to come home
