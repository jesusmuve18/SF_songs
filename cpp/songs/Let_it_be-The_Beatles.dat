Do                              Sol
When I find myself in times of trouble
   lam               Fa
Mother Mary comes to me
    Do                Sol        Fa Do
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be
                      Sol
And in my hour of darkness
           lam                 Fa
she is standing right in front of me
    Do              Sol          Fa Do
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be
<strong>
       lam        Sol
Let it be, let it be,
       Fa         Do
let it be, let it be
 Do                Sol          Fa
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be
</strong>
Do                  Sol
And when the broken hearted people
lam           Fa
living in the world agree
 Do               Sol           Fa Do
There will be an answer, let it be
                       Sol
For though they may be parted, 
         lam 
there is still a chance 
     Fa
that they will see
 Do                Sol          Fa Do
There will be an answer, let it be
<strong>
       lam        Sol
Let it be, let it be,
       Fa         Do
let it be, let it be
 Do                Sol          Fa
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be

Do                   Sol                  
And when the night is cloudy there is
lam                Fa
still a light that shines on me
 Do            Sol             Fa Do
Shinin' until tomorrow, let it be
                 Sol
I wake up to the sound of music, 
 lam         Fa
Mother Mary comes to me
  Do               Sol           Fa Do
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be
<strong>
       lam        Sol
Let it be, let it be,

There will be an answer, let it be

       lam        Sol
Let it be, let it be,
       Fa         Do
let it be, let it be
 Do                Sol          Fa
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be
