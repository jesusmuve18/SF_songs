Intro: Em G C G D/F#
       Em G C G D/F#

Em                     G
It comes and goes in waves
   C                         
It always runs back but it's 
 G                 D/F#
never quite the same
         Em                    
Well I think there's something 
            G
wrong with me
     C                  
Got nothing to believe, 
           G              D/F#
can't you see it on my face

       Em                    
I was going for the title, 
     G                   C
got hit by your tidal wave, 
 G
uh
 D/F#   Em
Can't stay in the shallows, 
        G
please tell me I won't wash
    C  G
 away
<strong>
         Em             
When it pulls me under, 
          G
will you make me stronger
          C                       
Will you be my breath through the 
 G            D/F#
deep, deep water
         Em      
Take me farther, 
                 G
give me one day longer
          C                       
Will you be my breath through the 
 G            D/F#
deep, deep water

Em                          G
  Ain't even scratched the surface
         C                                
Thinking I deserve the dream 
       G   
but I don't deserve the 
    D/F#
hurting
Em                              G
  I want the flame without the burning
       C                               
But I can't find my purpose 
        G      
when I don't know what my 
      D/F#
worth is

       Em
