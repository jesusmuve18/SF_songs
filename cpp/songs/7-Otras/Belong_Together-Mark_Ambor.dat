Am                 C
I know sleep is friends with death
   F                C        G
But maybe I should get some rest
       Am                   C          
'Cause I've been out here workin' 
  F           C G   
all damn day
Am                C
Blueberries and butterflies
      F                  C       G
The pretty things that greet my eyes
     Am              C           F
When you call and I say: I'm on my way

(One, two)
<strong>
Am      F     C      G
You and me belong together
      Am        F        C      G
Like cold iced tea and warmer weather
          Am               C
Where we lay out late underneath 

the pines
         F
And we still have fun 
         C          G
when the Sun won't shine
Am      F     C      G
You and me belong together all the time

Am     C       F
(Mmm, mmm, mmm)
     C  G
(Oh, woah)
 Am  C  F
</strong>
Am                    C
Spillin' wine and homemade drinks
    F                     C     G
We throw a cheers, the worries sink
Am                C          F    C G
Damnit, it's so good to be alive (wow)
Am                C
We know that we don't got much
    F                   C    G
But, then again, it's just enough
     Am           C          F
To always find a way for a good time

Am      F     C      G
You and me belong together

Where we lay out late underneath 

the pines

This love is all we need

Oh, we've got so much

You and me, oh

Am      F     C      G
You and me belong together

You and me belong together all the time

Am      C             F
It goes on and on and on (hey)
        C       G     Am
It goes on and on and on (hahaha)

It goes on and on and on
