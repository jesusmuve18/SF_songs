           <b>Re</b>
Loving can hurt, 
           <b>si m</b>
loving can hurt sometimes
             <b>La</b>
But it's the only thing 
             <b>Sol</b>
that I know
             <b>Re</b>
When it gets hard, 
                    <b>si m</b>
you know it can get hard sometimes
          <b>La</b>
It is the only thing 
                   <b>Sol</b>
makes us feel alive

<b>si m</b>                    <b>Sol</b>
We keep this love in a photograph
<b>Re</b>                     <b>La</b>
We made these memories for ourselves
          <b>si m</b>
Where our eyes are never closing
<b>Sol</b>
Hearts are never broken
    <b>Re</b>                         <b>La</b>
And time's forever frozen still
<strong>
           <b>Re</b>
So you can keep me
                          <b>La</b>
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
                           <b>si m</b>
Holding me closer 'til our eyes meet
                   <b>Sol</b>
You won't ever be alone, 
                         <b>Re</b>
wait for me to come home
</strong>
           <b>Re</b>
Loving can heal, 
           <b>si m</b>
loving can mend your soul
             <b>La</b>
And it's the only thing 
            <b>Sol</b>
that I know
                    <b>Re</b>
I swear it will get easier
                         <b>si m</b>
Remember that with every piece of ya
                     <b>La</b>
Hmm, and it's the only thing 
                            <b>Sol</b>
we take with us when we die

<b>si m</b>                    <b>Sol</b>
We keep this love in a photograph
<b>Re</b>                     <b>La</b>
We made these memories for ourselves
          <b>si m</b>
Where our eyes are never closing
<b>Sol</b>
Hearts are never broken
    <b>Re</b>                         <b>La</b>
And time's forever frozen still
<strong>
           <b>Re</b>
So you can keep me
                          <b>La</b>
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
                           <b>si m</b>
Holding me closer 'til our eyes meet
                   <b>Sol</b>
You won't ever be alone, 

           <b>Re</b>
And if you hurt me
                        <b>La</b>
That's okay, baby, only words bleed
                             <b>si m</b>
Inside these pages, you just hold me
                         <b>Sol</b>
And I won't ever let you go

                    <b>si m</b>
Wait for me to come home
                    <b>Sol</b>
Wait for me to come home
                    <b>Re</b>
Wait for me to come home
                    <b>La</b>
Wait for me to come home
</strong>
            <b>Re</b>
Oh, you can fit me

Inside the necklace you got 
              <b>La</b>
when you were sixteen

Next to your heartbeat 
        <b>si m</b>
where I should be
                         <b>Sol</b>
Keep it deep within your soul
<strong>
           <b>Re</b>
And if you hurt me
                        <b>La</b>
That's okay, baby, only words bleed
                             <b>si m</b>
Inside these pages, you just hold me
                         <b>Sol</b>
And I won't ever let you go
</strong>
         <b>Re</b>
When I'm away, I will remember 
        <b>La</b>
how you kissed me

Under the lamppost 
        <b>si m</b>
back on Sixth street
                                <b>Sol</b>
Hearing you whisper through the phone

Wait for me to come home
